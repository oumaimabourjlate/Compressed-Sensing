# This project about using Compressed-sensing for ECG recovery.
## The first part of the project is about the Compressed sensing theory, its assumption and its differences with claude-shannon theory.
## The seconf part is about the Sparsity and how we can find a sparse representation of the ECG signals using Deep Learning.
