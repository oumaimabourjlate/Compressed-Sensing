# This project about using Compressed-sensing for ECG recovery.
## The first part of teh project is about the Compressed sensing theoryn its assumption, its differences when it comes to claude-shannon theory.
## The seconf part is about the Sparsity and how we can find a sparse representation of the ECG signals using Dee Learning
