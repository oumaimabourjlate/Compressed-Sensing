# This project about using Compressed-sensing for ECG recovery.
## The first part of the project focuses on compressed sensing theory, its assumptions, and its differences from the Claude-Shannon theory.
## The second part focuses on sparsity and how to obtain a sparse representation of ECG signals using deep learning.
